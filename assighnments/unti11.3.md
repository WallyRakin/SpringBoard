- **What ***git*** command creates a branch?**

  The `git branch <branch-name>` command creates a new branch.

- **What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?**

  A fast-forward merge moves the branch pointer forward when there are no divergent commits, while a recursive merge creates a new commit to combine changes from divergent branches.

- **What ***git*** command changes to another branch?**

  The `git checkout <branch-name>` or `git switch <branch-name>` command switches to another branch.

- **What ***git*** command deletes a branch?**

  The `git branch -d <branch-name>` command deletes a branch. Use `-D` to force delete.

- **How do merge conflicts happen?**

  Merge conflicts occur when changes from different branches modify the same part of a file, and Git cannot automatically reconcile them.
