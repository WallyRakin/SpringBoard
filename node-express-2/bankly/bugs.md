## **1. Asynchronous Error Handling in auth.js: `.post('/login')`**

In the "/login" route of "auth.js", the **`User.authenticate`** function is presumably asynchronous (since it likely interacts with a database), but it's not awaited. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors since the subsequent code won't wait for the authentication process to complete before executing.

**Error Location**: **`auth.js`**, in the **`router.post('/login')`** block.
**Potential Solution**: Use **`await`** with the **`User.authenticate`** function to ensure the code execution waits for the authentication process to complete.

## 2**. Unauthorized warning in auth.js: `.post('/login')`**

The code is supposed to raise a 401 error when an invalid pair of username and password is entered, but it fails to do so. This can result in incorrect or unauthorized access to the system.

**Error Location**: **`auth.js`**, in the **`router.post('/login')`** block.
**Potential Solution**: Add proper error handling to raise a 401 error when an invalid pair of username and password is detected.

## 3. Missing error message in users.js: **`.get('/:username')`**

In the "users.js" file, there is no check for the scenario when no user is found in the **`User.get`** function. This could result in unexpected behavior or confusion for users if they try to retrieve information for a non-existent user.

**Error Location**: **`users.js`**, in the **`router.get('/:username')`** block.
**Potential Solution**: Add an error message or appropriate handling when no user is found to inform users about the issue.

## 4. Missing error message in users.js: `.patch('/:username')`

In the "users.js" file, there is no check for the scenario when no user is found in the `User.patch` function. This could result in unexpected behavior or confusion for users if they try to update information for a non-existent user.

**Error Location**: `users.js`, in the `router.patch('/:username')` block.
**Potential Solution**: Add an error message or appropriate handling when no user is found to inform users about the issue.

## 5. Vulnerabilities found in users.js: `.patch('/:username')`

In the "users.js" file, the `.patch('/:username')` route accepts any parameter, which poses a security vulnerability. It should only allow the parameters `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone`, and `email` to be updated.

**Error Location**: `users.js`, in the `router.patch('/:username')` block.
**Potential Solution**: Update the code to validate and accept only the specified parameters (`first_name`, `last_name`, `phone`, and `email`) for the `.patch('/:username')` route to mitigate the security vulnerability.

## 6**. Asynchronous error Handling in users.js: `.delete('/:username')`**

In the "users.js" file, the **`User.delete`** function in the **`router.delete('/:username')`** block doesn't have an **`await`** keyword before it, which implies it's either not asynchronous (unlikely for a delete operation involving a database) or it's missing the **`await`**, which would cause inconsistent behavior and error handling.

**Error Location**: **`users.js`**, in the **`router.delete('/:username')`** block.
**Potential Solution**: If the **`User.delete`** function is asynchronous, ensure it's prefixed with **`await`** to handle the operation and errors correctly.

## 7**. Missing error message in users.js: `.delete('/:username')`**

In the "users.js" file, there is no check for the scenario when no user is found in the **`User.delete`** function. This could result in unexpected behavior or confusion for users if they try to delete a non-existent user.

**Error Location**: **`users.js`**, in the **`router.delete('/:username')`** block.
**Potential Solution**: Add an error message or appropriate handling when no user is found to inform users about the issue.
