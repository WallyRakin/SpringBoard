### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?
  - A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact web token that can be transferred between two parties, typically used in authentication and information exchange.

- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?
  - The signature portion of a JWT is a cryptographic mechanism that secures the token, ensuring that it hasn't been altered. It's generated by encoding the header and payload with a secret key and helps in verifying the token's authenticity.

- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
  - If a JWT is intercepted, the attacker can see what's inside the payload because the information is only encoded, not encrypted. However, they cannot alter the payload without invalidating the signature.

- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.
  - Authentication with JWT involves issuing a token upon successful login, which the client then includes in the header of subsequent requests. The server verifies the token's validity before granting access, ensuring the user is authenticated.

- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
  - Unit tests assess individual components for functionality, integration tests check how different parts work together, and end-to-end tests simulate user scenarios to test the complete user expreience.

- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?
  - A mock is a simulated object that mimics the behavior of real objects in controlled ways. They are typically used to test interactions with external systems, like databases or APIs, without involving the actual systems.

- What is continuous integration?
  - Continuous integration is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests are run to catch issues early.

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
  - An environment variable is a dynamic value that can affect the way running processes will affect the code. They are used to manage dynamic values for an application making it more flexibe and able to work in differnt enviroments.

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
  - TDD (Test-Driven Development) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code. Benefits include better design, fewer bugs, and more maintainable code, while some drawbacks would be an initial learning curve and a longer development time.

- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
  - Using JSONSchema for validation ensures that the data structure adheres to a predefined format, improving data integrity and making it easier to understand and manipulate the data.

- What are some ways to decide which code to test?
  - Deciding which code to test often involves assessing risk, changes, and complexity. High-risk areas, frequently changed code, and complex functions. Figuring out which code to test will based on what you more greatly prioritize.

- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?
  - The RETURNING clause in SQL is used after an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement to return the affected rows. It's useful for obtaining values from inserted or updated rows without a separate query.

- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?
  - WebSockets allow for full-duplex communication, meaning data can be sent and received simultaneously, which is ideal for real-time applications. HTTP is a request/response protocol where each request initiates a new connection in a stateless manner.

- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?
  - Express, I very much prefer JavaScript over Python.
